[ðŸ”— Live Demo](https://ca-stella.github.io/odin-etch_a_sketch/)

This is an Etch-a-Sketch made as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch">The Odin Project</a>. 

I had a lot of fun making this project! The webpage includes a grid of squares that you can fill by clicking and hovering. Clicking a second time will stop painting the squares. Clicking the reset button will allow you to resize the grid and/or reset the grid to the initial blank canvas. 

In terms of painting, there are various options you can choose in the side menu: 
- paint/fill square with a chosen colour 
- shade to darken the current colour of the square (to approach black)
- lighten to progressively make the square lighter (to approach white)
- randomize colour
- erase current square 

### Outcomes
- Got more familiar with different html element types and DOM events
- Used various JavaScript functions 
- Learned to use Font Asesome Icons
- Got a better understanding of the RGBA scale 
- Implemented a custom cursor style for the eraser function
- Played around with media queries to accommodate for different screen sizes
- Used Git and GitHub for overall project management
